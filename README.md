# Customer-Analytics-Segmentation-using-PCA-and-K-means-clustering
This project implements Principal Component Analysis to reduce our dimensions to three components and then use K-means clustering to segment the customers based on these three components. The dataset used is from a FMCG store and I make use of the Python modules- scikit learn, scipy, seaborn, pandas and numpy.
